# The New Plugin Core

The New Plugin Core, TNPC, is a library that speeds up plugin development by
provided helper classes to provide a higher level creation environment that
takes care of the boring plugin foundation classes such as commands,
message formatting, menu systems, and more. The aim is to provide a common set
of classes that wraps over multiple server implementations, bukkit/sponge.
